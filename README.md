## Phase 1: Failure Detection & Prediction (January 2026)
Status: ✅ 100% COMPLETE

Phase 1 focuses on detecting and predicting network failures using QML. It includes simulations, data pipelines, model training, and evaluations.

### Key Highlights from Docs
- Achieved high accuracy in failure detection (e.g., 100% with some models).
- Used Mininet for simulations and Qiskit/Pennylane for quantum models.

### Code & Artifacts
- See [code/Phase1/](code/Phase1/) for scripts (e.g., QML models, simulations).
- Dependencies: Updated in [requirements.txt](requirements.txt).
